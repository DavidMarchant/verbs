Inspired by the art piece "Verb List" by Richard Serra, this program generates paths of synonyms between words. I wanted to see how the words of the list related to one another, the chains are surprisingly short.

There are two sets of words in the correct format supplied (words-WordNet.csv and words-Moby.csv) & either's good. They're both just CSV with the first element of each line being the "root" word. Fair warning, this doesn't work properly with input files with more than one entry per root.

There's another version - serra-DEPRECIATED.rb - that DOES work except:
  - it uses DFS so the paths it generates are extremely long.
  - it's recursive & QUICKLY reaches Ruby's stack frame limit & crashes out. So it doesn't work.
The other version models the connections as a graph & uses BFS.

It's pretty fast, max O(n) input thesaurus with n entries.
